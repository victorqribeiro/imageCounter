# Image Counter

A simple page view counter that store data as text and shows the counter as a PNG image.

## How to use it

Host these files on a cheap / free PHP server somewhere. Create a image element that points to it.
**Don't forget to give write permission**

**HTML Image** 
```
<img src='https://my_cheap_server/imageCounter'>
```

**MarkDown Image**  
```
![pageviews](https://my_cheap_server/imageCounter)
```

An example of this in use can be seen when you visit my [GitHub profile][github] page.
